# Movie-Library

## Description

A movie search app where you can search for movies and add favorite movies to a library.

## Motivation
I built this app as a way to learn and practise React.
It uses the old prop-drilling method for state management.  

An updated version using React hooks and Context API can be found in [Personal-Movie-Library](https://github.com/annlinros/Personal-Movie-Library) repository.
